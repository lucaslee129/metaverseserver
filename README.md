- Push your updated project to your git repo and share URL.

## Environment
- OS: Windows 10, 11
- Node: >18.13.0

## Node.js & Express server template
The server is just a template within Node.js, Express and Mongoose.


### Requirement 
Develop an endpoint that facilitates the signing process using Metamask, ensuring the verification of transactions made by the Metamask wallet and the accompanying subtext.
The object included in the client's request is as follows.

```bash
  {
    "transaction": "0x.....",
    "walletAddress": "0x.....",
